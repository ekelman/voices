Most of us do and in fact many of you have even recommended your friends for jobs. &nbsp;Employers call this recruiting source &ldquo;the referral&rdquo; and it is extremely effective.&nbsp; The friend gets a great job and the employer gets a great employee.&nbsp; At Bohire we&rsquo;re taking this a step further.&nbsp; The friend still gets the great job, the employer still gets the great employee and now you get the <strong>great cash reward!</strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />As a Bohire Referrer you can refer your friends to any job posting on our website.&nbsp; If your friend is hired by the company, you get paid the Referral Reward. Rewards will vary depending on starting compensation but Bohire Referrers can expect to earn thousands of dollars per hire. Sound amazing? It gets even better&hellip;..<br /><br />At Bohire, we want great Referrers joining our Job Referral Community. In addition to earning thousands of dollars for each successful referral, you can earn significant bonuses just by recommending Bohire to others. &nbsp;For example, you recommend the Bohire website to ten of your friends.&nbsp; Your friends know great people so they join as Referrers (they must list you as their Referrer during the sign up process).&nbsp; They start successfully referring their friends to great jobs and you earn a 5% bonus for each successful referral they make.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s that easy!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
